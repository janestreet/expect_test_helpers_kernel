  (** [hide_positions_in_string] does line-based regexp matching to replace line numbers

  (** [print_bin_ios] prints the shape digest of a [Binable] type, and the bin-io
      serialization of example values.  [print_bin_ios] is used to write expect tests that
      can detect if the serialization format of a stable type changes. *)
  val print_bin_ios
    :  (module Print_bin_ios_arg with type t = 'a)
    -> 'a list
    -> unit

  (** [print_bin_ios_with_max] is like [print_bin_ios], except it causes a CR to be
      printed (using [require]) if any serializations are longer than the supplied
      [max_binable_length].  This is useful for ensuring that serializations fit in some
      required size, e.g. an ethernet MTU. *)

  (** [require here bool] is a no-op if [bool = true], but if not, prints a [CR
      require-failed:], which will appear in the expect-test output.  The CR will appear
      in the feature owner's [fe todo], thus preventing release of the feature.  [require]
      is an expect-test-friendly version of [assert].  It works with the normal
      expect-test workflow because it does not raise, and it prevents mistakenly releasing
      features that violate a required property.  There is no need to 'X' a [CR
      require-failed]; simply fix the property tested by the [require] and re-run the test
      to restore the empty output.

      [require] prints [if_false_then_print_s] only if [bool = false].  It is useful for
      including information that may help debug the problem, but that would otherwise be
      too voluminous.  [if_false_then_print_s] is lazy to avoid construction of the sexp
      except when needed. *)
  val require
    :  ?cr             : CR.t (** default is [CR]    *)

    -> unit

  (** [show_raise] calls [f ()] and prints the exception that it raises, or, if it doesn't
      raise, prints [did not raise].  [show_raise] ignores the result of [f] so that one
      doesn't have to put an [ignore] inside the body of an [f] that is expected to raise.
      [~hide_positions:true] operates as in [print_s], to make output less fragile.  Using
      [~show_backtrace:true] will result in a CR in the expectation, but it's still
      available here as it is still valuable when initially writing tests and
      debugging. *)

    :  ?hide_positions : bool (** default is [false] *)
    -> ?show_backtrace : bool (** default is [false] *)
    -> (unit -> _)
    -> unit

  (** [require_does_not_raise] is like [show_raise], but does not print anything if the
      function does not raise, and prints a CR along with the exception if it does raise.
      Unlike for [show_raise], the supplied function is required to return [unit] to avoid
      mistakes like incomplete partial application that silently would not raise, but for
      the wrong reason. *)

    :  ?cr             : CR.t (** default is [CR]    *)
    -> ?hide_positions : bool (** default is [false] *)

  (** [require_does_raise] is like [show_raise], but additionally prints a CR if the
      function does not raise. *)
  val require_does_raise

    -> ?hide_positions : bool (** default is [false] *)

  (** [require_allocation_does_not_exceed] is a specialized form of [require] that only
      produces output when [f ()] allocates more than the given limits.  The output will
      include the actual number of major and minor words allocated.  We do NOT include
      these numbers in the successful case because those numbers are not stable with
      respect to compiler versions and build flags.

      If [f] returns a value that should be ignored, use this idiom:

      {[
        ignore (show_allocation f : t)
      ]}

      rather than this idiom:

      {[
        show_allocation (fun () -> ignore (f () : t))
      ]}

      With the latter idiom, the compiler may optimize the computation of [f ()] taking
      advantage of the fact that the result is ignored, and eliminate allocation that is
      intended to be measured.  With the former idiom, the compiler cannot do such
      optimization and must compute the result of [f ()]. *)

  (** [print_and_check_container_sexps] prints the sexp representation of maps, sets, hash
      tables, and hash sets based on the given values.  For sets and hash sets, prints a
      CR if the sexp does not correspond to a list of elements.  For maps and hash tables,
      prints a CR if the sexp does not correspond to an association list keyed on
      elements. *)
